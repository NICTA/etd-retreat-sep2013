Code Exercises

### Abstract

Following is a list of programming exercises of increasing difficulty. Select 
one or more exercises according to the available time to complete. Exercise 0 
should be completed prior to commencement of other exercises. Each exercise 
typically takes on a form whereby it transforms a given input.

Any programming language or environment may be used, with the provision that 
such an environment is capable of completing Exercise 0.

Exercises specify that a result should be "printed." To print a result is to 
display it on the standard output stream of the program process. Further, 
exercises specify that some data is "input." This data is provided either as a 
command line argument, or as standard input, to the program process.

### Exercise 0 - Preparation

Produce an executable script or program, such that given a string as input, 
print the string "hello" followed by that given string.

Example:

    > exercise0 Fred
    hello Fred

    > exercise0 Mary
    hello Fred

### Exercise 1 - Product results in largest palindrome

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from 
the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Print the largest palindrome made from the product of two 4-digit numbers.

### Exercise 2 - Smallest multiple with common divisors

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 
10 without any remainder.

Given an integer between 1 and 50 on the input (n), print the smallest positive 
number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n.

Example:

    > exercise2 7
    420

    > exercise2 15
    360360

    > exercise2 10
    2520

### Exercise 3 - URL Encoder

Encode a URL such that special characters are replaced by a given string of
characters. The encoding rules are as follows:

    '+' -> "%2B"
    ' ' -> "%20"
    '#' -> "%23"
    '%' -> "%25"

All other characters remain unchanged.

Example:

    > exercise3 http://google.com/
    http://google.com/

    > exercise3 http://google.com/?a b
    http://google.com/?a%20b

    > exercise3 http://google.com/?a b&x=#y
    http://google.com/?a%20b&x=%23y

    > exercise3 http://google.com/?a b&x=#y&%+f=g%
    http://google.com/?a%20b&x=%23y&%25%2Bf=g%25

### Exercise 4 - Difference of the sum of the squares

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural 
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Given an integer between 1 and 200 on the input (n), print the difference 
between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the square of 
the sum.

Example:

    > exercise4 10
    2640

    > exercise4 100
    25164150

    > exercise4 120
    52124380

### Exercise 5 - Largest product in a series of digits

Given 1000 consecutive arbitrary digits (a digit is [0-9]) as input, print the
greatest product of any 5 consecutive digits of that input.

Example:

    > exercise5 73167176531330624919225119674426574742355349194934\

### Exercise 6 - Highly divisible Triangular Number

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So 
the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten 
terms would be:

    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

     1: 1
     3: 1,3
     6: 1,2,3,6
    10: 1,2,5,10
    15: 1,3,5,15
    21: 1,3,7,21
    28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

Given an integer between 1 and 1000 as input (n), print the value of the first 
triangle number to have over n divisors.

Example:

    > exercise6 5
    28

    > exercise6 12
    120

    > exercise6 16
    300

### Exercise 7 - Palindromes of base 10 and base 2

The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001₂ (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Given an integer between 5000 and 5000000 as input (n), print the sum of all 
positive numbers, less than n, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.

Note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.

Example:

    > exercise7 100
    157

    > exercise7 1000
    1772

    > exercise7 100000
    286602

    > exercise7 2000000
    6544940

### Exercise 8 - Maximise the value of items

Given an odd number (3 or greater) of integers as input, call the first integer 
the maximum possible weight (M) and the remaining pairs of integers a list of 
value and associated weight of some items.

Select any items (pair of value and weight) and print the sum of their values 
such that the following hold:

* the sum of the individual values of the items is equal to, or greater than, 
any other possible selection of items.
* the sum of the individual weights of the items does not exceed the maximum 
possible weight (M).

Example (M=100):

    > exercise8 3 3 2 4 1 5 3
    7

    > exercise8 4 3 2 4 1 5 3
    9

    > exercise8 5 3 2 4 1 5 3
    9

    > exercise8 100 40 100 35 50 18 45 4 20 10 10 2 5
    55

### Exercise 9 - Write a Cheque

Given a string representing a numeric value of money on the input, print the 
verbatim transcription of that amount in English words.

For example, the input "1.11" will result in a return value of "one dollar and 
eleven cents". Pluralisation should be grammatically correct. For example, 
"1.01" produces "one dollar and one cent".

Invalid characters should be ignored, meaning that every input string has an 
output string. The empty string produces "zero dollars and zero cents".

Example:

    > exercise9 0
    zero dollars and zero cents

    > exercise9 1
    one dollar and zero cents

    > exercise9 0.1
    zero dollars and ten cents

    > exercise9 1.
    one dollar and zero cents

    > exercise9 0.
    zero dollars and zero cents

    > exercise9 0.0
    zero dollars and zero cents

    > exercise9 .34
    zero dollars and thirty-four cents

    > exercise9 0.3456789
    zero dollars and thirty-four cents

    > exercise9 1.0
    one dollar and zero cents

    > exercise9 1.01
    one dollar and one cent

    > exercise9 a1a
    one dollar and zero cents

    > exercise9 a1a.a0.7b
    one dollar and seven cents

    > exercise9 100
    one hundred dollars and zero cents

    > exercise9 100.0
    one hundred dollars and zero cents

    > exercise9 100.00
    one hundred dollars and zero cents

    > exercise9 100.00000
    one hundred dollars and zero cents

    > exercise9 1000456.13
    one million four hundred and fifty-six dollars and thirteen cents

    > exercise9 1001456.13
    one million one thousand four hundred and fifty-six dollars and thirteen cents

    > exercise9 16000000456.13
    sixteen billion four hundred and fifty-six dollars and thirteen cents

    > exercise9 100.45
    one hundred dollars and forty-five cents

    > exercise9 100.07
    one hundred dollars and seven cents

    > exercise9 9abc9def9ghi.jkl9mno
    nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars and ninety cents

    > exercise9 12345.67
    twelve thousand three hundred and forty-five dollars and sixty-seven cents
